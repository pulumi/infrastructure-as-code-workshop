# Infrastructure as Code Workshop

This workshop teaches you Infrastructure as Code concepts through a series of hands-on labs. Topics covered include IaC fundamentals, in addition to application architectures and how to use IaC to create, update, and manage them.

This workshop uses AWS although most concepts are applicable no matter what cloud provider you are using.
